Enviroment variables are operating system level variables, their form is
a name value pair so for the enviroment files we need to store them in a structure
in this case a list, every block of the list has 2 subblocks, name and value which
are the name and value of the enviroment variable, the functions that we require will be:
-size of the eviroment variable, so that we can reserve storage registries with malloc
-enviroment init, to initialize the enviroment variables and storage required to use them
-A function that stores the values for said variables

We will also need checkers so that enviroment variables are correctly stored and 
aren't a load of shit, and a function that allows us to return the value of the 
variable to later use in the builtins

(I'm guessing this is optional but recommended,they are sorted in the terminal) An enviroment variable sorter, so that we sort them alphabetically so that it is easier to read.
